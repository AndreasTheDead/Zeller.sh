# Who am I

I'm a 24-year-old IT engineer from Germany.
I was Trainee and now work in a company with around 13000 Employees from which around 7000 are working with AD Accounts.

In my team, I am the go-to person if some things need to get automated with PowerShell. This can be a simple task like a weekly report about AD topics, the creation of 50 Distribution Groups or bigger things like the Creation and assignment of File ACL Groups for a Network Share. I also manage Scripts to install software via Intune or create Proactive Remediation to do things that are not possible over native Intune ways.

In my free time, I mostly like to game or work on my Homelab, as well as, go on hikes or meet my friends.
